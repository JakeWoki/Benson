What I did to get the IDE working:

1) Go to > http://arduino.cc/en/main/software and download the 1.5.7 IDE

2) Install the Udoo patch > http://www.udoo.org/ProjectsAndTutorials/get-the-arduino-ide-ready-to-program-udoo/

3) Download the Arduino IDE for the Udoo > http://www.udoo.org/downloads/#tab4

4) Copy the library folder from the IDE downloaded in step three into the library folder in IDE you downloaded in step one.

Its a little hacky but getting Google's ADK to work was a pain.
